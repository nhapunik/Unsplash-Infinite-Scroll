#Unsplash Infinite Scroll Gallery by NhDev


Hi, I'm NhDev! I have created this Unsplash Infinite Scroll Gallery to demonstrate my JavaScript skills, as well as my ability to work with APIs. This project features a sleek and futuristic design, making it visually appealing while providing practical functionality.

##Project Overview

This web application utilizes the Unsplash API to search for and display images based on user input. As users scroll through the gallery, more images are loaded automatically, creating an infinite scroll effect. This project showcases my ability to:

- Implement JavaScript to handle user input and interaction

- Work with APIs to fetch and display data

- Create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

- Apply modern CSS styles to create an engaging user interface

##How to Use


To use the Unsplash Infinite Scroll Gallery, simply enter a search query into the search box and press "Enter" or click the "Search" button. Images related to your query will be fetched from the Unsplash API and displayed in a visually appealing grid layout. As you scroll through the gallery, more images will be loaded automatically, ensuring you never run out of content to explore.
